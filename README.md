# Stilt Fox&trade; Scribe
Stilt Fox&trade; scribe is a C++ library designed to make dealing with files and other related IO tasks easier. This convenience
library used to be a part of Stilt Fox&trade; universal library, however was split into its own repository for better maintainability.
This Library won't be updated often as well, reading a file doesn't change often. So unless a bug is discovered, or new functionality
is required, this library should stay rather static.
